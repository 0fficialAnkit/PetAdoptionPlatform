This Java application is a simple console-based platform for managing pet adoption details. It connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve pet information, allowing users to add new pets and view all available pets.

- **View All Pets**: Displays a list of all pets stored in the database.

## Requirements
- **Java**: JDK 8 or higher
- **MySQL Database**: A MySQL server running locally with a database named `pet_adoption`
- **JDBC Driver**: MySQL JDBC Driver (Connector/J)

## Setup

### 1. Database Configuration
